In the early 2010s, a crisis of reproducibility rocked the field of psychology.
Following a period of reflection, the field has responded with radical reform of its scientific practices.
More recently, similar questions about the reproducibility of machine learning research have also come to the fore.
In this short paper, we present select ideas from psychology's reformation, translating them into relevance for a machine learning audience.
