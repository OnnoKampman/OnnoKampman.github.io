**Introduction** Mental health issues such as depression and anxiety are highly and disproportionally prevalent among university students.
Beyond the academic rigour, stressors imposed by a new environment result in them being vulnerable to the onset and manifestation of mental health symptomatology.
Leveraging smartphones and wearables for digital phenotyping capabilities is an innovative approach for monitoring and intervening in the mental health conditions of university students.
This provides a unique opportunity to collect and identify digital and behavioural biomarkers, subsequently enabling the development of predictive models to identify university students at risk.
**Methods and analysis** This study—Brightline—will employ an observational study design over a 6-month period, recruiting 500 students from a major public university in Singapore.
Passive data collection will occur continuously throughout the monitoring period through a wearable device (Fitbit Charge 6) and smartphone sensors via the Brightline app, which uses a digital phenotyping data collection platform.
Active data collection will consist of self-report questionnaires to be completed at the beginning of the study and follow-up assessments at 1, 3 and 6 months after.
The passive and active data collected will be analysed to identify the digital biomarkers associated with depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and affect among university students.
Predictive models of these mental health issues will also be developed.
**Ethics and dissemination** This study was approved by the Nanyang Technological University Institutional Review Board (IRB-2023-894).
Findings from this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at academic conferences.
Trial registration number NCT06770075.
