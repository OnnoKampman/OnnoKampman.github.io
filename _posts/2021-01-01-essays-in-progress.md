This post describes my approach to essay writing.

I’ve decided to start publishing occasional essays—short pieces on things I’m thinking about, exploring, or trying to understand better.
These won’t be polished takes or final conclusions.
Instead, I’ll treat them as living documents: open to revision, correction, and rethinking.

Each post will be tracked publicly using Git, so you can see what’s changed, when, and why.
Consider it an experiment in transparent thinking—where changing your mind is part of the point.
