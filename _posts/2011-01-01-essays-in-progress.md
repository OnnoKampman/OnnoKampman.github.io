This post describes my approach to essay writing.

I’ve decided to start publishing occasional essays—short pieces on things I’m thinking about, exploring, or trying to understand better.
These won’t be polished takes or final conclusions (those are more reserved for peer-reviewed publications).
Instead, I’ll treat them as living documents: open to revision, correction, and rethinking.

Each post will be tracked publicly on GitHub, so everyone can see what’s changed, when, and why.
Consider it an experiment in transparent thinking, where changing your mind is part of the point.

Some housekeeping.
I may use AI tools from time to time to help with my writing, but I always take full responsibility for the output.
The views and opinions expressed in these essays are my own, and do not represent the views of any organization I am affiliated or have been affiliated with.
