This essay discusses the cognitive tool of thinking in spectra and extremes.

## The Extremes Analysis: A Cognitive Tool for Better Thinking

We live in a world that loves simple answers to complex questions.
Social media algorithms reward hot takes, news cycles favor dramatic headlines, and most conversations seem to push us toward picking a side.
On a more personal level, many of us also struggle with jumping to conclusions, or catastrophizing events in our lives.
But most interesting problems don't have simple solutions, and most disagreements aren't as black-and-white as they appear.

I've found that one simple cognitive tool can cut through a lot of this noise: extremes analysis.
This framework builds on top of a [previously discuss cognitive tool](https://onnokampman.github.io/posts/2024/08/the-limits-of-thinking/){:target="_blank"}.
The idea is straightforward – when you're trying to understand a complex issue or navigate a difficult conversation, start by identifying the most extreme positions possible on both ends of the spectrum.
Once you have scoped out the complete "map" of the issue, work backwards to see where reasonable people actually disagree on a political topic, or uncover the actual roots of a disagreement.

### How Extremes Analysis Works

The process is deceptively simple: when confronted with a contentious issue or complex decision, identify the two most extreme positions possible.
Then, work backwards from those extremes to find where reasonable people actually disagree and where unexpected common ground might exist.

This approach works because it does a few useful things.
It helps you realize that most people don't actually hold the extreme positions that get the most attention online.
It shows you the full range of what's actually being debated.
And it creates room for more thoughtful conversation by establishing some boundaries around what you're really disagreeing about.

### The Abortion Example: Finding Common Ground

Consider the abortion debate, which remains one of the most emotionally charged topics in modern politics.
The public discourse often presents this as a simple binary: you're either "pro-choice" or "pro-life," with no middle ground possible and healthy debate often lacking.

But let's apply extremes analysis.
At one extreme, we might imagine a position that any interference with conception – even basic contraception – is morally wrong.
At the other extreme, we could envision a stance that terminating a pregnancy is acceptable right up until the moment of birth, regardless of circumstances.

When we map out these extremes, something interesting happens: we realize that very few people actually hold either position.
Most people are comfortable with contraception and emergency contraception.
Similarly, most people, regardless of their general views on abortion, feel uncomfortable with late-term procedures absent severe medical complications.

Once we acknowledge these extremes and recognize that they represent tiny minorities, the real conversation can begin.
The actual debate exists in the middle – roughly between the first few weeks of pregnancy and the point of viability.
Within this range, we can have substantive discussions about scientific questions (when does consciousness begin?), philosophical considerations (what constitutes personhood?), and practical policy matters (how do we balance competing rights and interests?).

This reframing doesn't eliminate disagreement, but it grounds the discussion in reality rather than caricature, making genuine dialogue possible.

### Mental Health Treatment: Moving Beyond "Therapy vs. Medication"

When I think about how we process information and make sense of the world, I can't help but think about mental health too.
So much of our psychological wellbeing hinges on how clearly we can think, and poor mental health often distorts healthy cognitive patterns.
For example, in my work trying to bridge AI and mental health care, I frequently encounter the oversimplified debate of "therapy versus medication" for treating mental health conditions.
This binary framing creates unnecessary conflict between different approaches that often work best in combination.

Let's map the extremes.
On one end, imagine a position that all mental health struggles are purely biochemical and should only be treated with medication – that therapy is essentially useless wishful thinking.
People are reduced to machines and numbers on spreadsheets.
On the other end, picture the view that all mental health issues stem from psychological or social factors, and that medication is always harmful or just masking symptoms.
Everyone is unique and any kind of quantification or categorization is evil.

When we lay out these extremes, we see that almost no mental health professionals hold either position.
Even the most biochemically-oriented psychiatrists recognize that therapy can be valuable, and even the most therapy-focused psychologists acknowledge that some conditions benefit significantly from medication and that some sort of quantification of severity can be helpful for triaging individuals.

The real conversation happens in the middle.
Which combinations of treatments work best for which conditions?
How do we personalize treatment approaches?
What role might emerging technologies like AI-assisted therapy play?
These discussions become much more productive when we're not defending extreme positions that few people actually hold.
When we start conversations with establishing that our opponents are capable of some nuance at least, we can engage in a less emotional fashion too.

### Economic Policy and the Role of Government

Economic debates often get framed as capitalism versus socialism, but extremes analysis reveals this as another false binary.
One extreme would be a completely unregulated market with no government intervention whatsoever – no antitrust laws, no safety regulations, no environmental protections, no public goods like roads or schools.
The other extreme would be complete government control of all economic activity – no private property, no market mechanisms, no individual economic choices.

Most people reject both extremes.
Even the most ardent free-market advocates typically support some basic regulations and public goods.
Even democratic socialists usually support some role for markets and private enterprise.
Again, the meaningful debate occurs in the vast middle ground.
What's the optimal balance between market freedom and government regulation?
How do we harness market efficiency while addressing market failures?
These conversations become more productive when we're not caricaturing each other's positions.

### Why This Approach Works

This cognitive tool has several practical advantages.
It helps you stay humble about complex issues by showing you that they're usually more complicated than they first appear.
It makes conversations less adversarial because you're not constantly defending against strawman versions of your position.
Most importantly, it shifts the focus from winning arguments to solving problems.
Instead of trying to prove that your "side" is completely right, you can focus on finding practical solutions within the space where reasonable disagreement exists.

### How to Use It

To try extremes analysis yourself, start by pushing past the mainstream positions on whatever issue you're thinking about.
Ask yourself: what would someone believe if they took this logic to its absolute limit?
What would the complete opposite look like? Really stretch to find the true endpoints.
Then step back and ask: where do most reasonable people actually disagree?
What assumptions are we all sharing without realizing it?
What common ground exists that gets lost when we focus only on the most dramatic disagreements?

This won't solve every argument or eliminate all conflicts.
People will still disagree based on different values, experiences, and priorities, and that's fine and good.
But it can help those disagreements be more productive and less frustrating for everyone involved.

The goal isn't to find some perfect middle ground where everyone agrees.
It's to make sure you're actually disagreeing about the right things – the real issues where thoughtful people can reasonably come to different conclusions.
In a world full of artificial polarization and extremist thoughts, that's a pretty valuable skill.
