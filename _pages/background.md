I'm a cognitive scientist by training, with an interdisciplinary background spanning AI, neuroscience, physics, linguistics, psychology, and philosophy.

I completed my PhD in the [Adaptive Brain Lab](https://www.abg.psychol.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Cambridge's Department of Psychology, under the supervision of [Zoe Kourtzi](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/professor-zoe-kourtzi){:target="_blank"} and [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk){:target="_blank"}.
Here, I worked on AI for Brain Science and Mental Health and computational cognitive neuroscience approaches to learning and decision making.

Before my PhD, I helped establish a machine learning team at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications.

During my MPhil, supervised by [Pascale Fung](http://www.ee.ust.hk/~pascale/){:target="_blank"}, I worked on several projects related to natural language processing and affective computing.
Working with [Genta Indra Winata](https://gentawinata.com/){:target="_blank"}, I built a virtual therapist platform that used deep learning to model user emotional states and generate empathetic dialogue-an early preview of my current work at the intersection of AI and mental health.

I received my undergrad degree in Applied Physics from the TU Delft in the Netherlands.
