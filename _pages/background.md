I completed my PhD in the [Adaptive Brain Lab](https://www.abg.psychol.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Cambridge's Department of Psychology, under the supervision of [Zoe Kourtzi](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/professor-zoe-kourtzi){:target="_blank"} and [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk){:target="_blank"}.
Here, I worked on AI for Brain Science and Mental Health and computational cognitive neuroscience approaches to learning and decision making.

Prior to that I helped establish a machine learning team at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.

During my MPhil, supervised by [Pascale Fung](http://www.ee.ust.hk/~pascale/){:target="_blank"}, I worked on several projects related to affective computing.
I worked with [Genta Indra Winata](https://gentaiscool.github.io/){:target="_blank"} on a virtual therapist self-help platform.
We modelled user affect state with deep learning methods to construct emotionally intelligent dialogue.

I received my undergrad degree in Applied Physics from the TU Delft in the Netherlands.
