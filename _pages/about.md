Thanks for visiting my website!

At the moment, I mainly work as a data scientist, manager, and strategist at the [MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT)](https://moht.com.sg){:target="_blank"} in Singapore.
I work on a portfolio of projects at the intersection of AI and mental health.
My general aims are to explore how technology can help scale and improve our mental health care systems.
Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:onno.kampman@moht.com.sg">onno.kampman@moht.com.sg</a> if you have similar interests.

I am currently also involved with [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.github.io){:target="_blank"}.
This is a non-profit organization that aims to boost AI performance and inclusion for Southeast Asia.

I also remain affiliated with the University of Cambridge as a [Visiting Scientist](https://neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/member/opk20){:target="_blank"}.
My research focuses on developing algorithms for the characterization of brain connectivity based on MRI scans, and how brain connectivity is altered in depressed individuals.
