Thanks for visiting!

I lead AI initiatives for [mindline.sg](https://mindline.sg){:target="_blank"}, Singapore's national digital platform for mental health, at the [MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT)](https://moht.com.sg){:target="_blank"}.
My work focuses on a portfolio of projects at the intersection of AI and mental health, exploring how technology can help scale and improve our mental health care systems.

This semester, I'm [teaching](https://onnokampman.com/teaching) a course on AI for Healthcare at the National University of Singapore.

I'm also involved with [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.github.io){:target="_blank"}, a non-profit organization working to boost AI performance and inclusion across Southeast Asia.

Additionally, I remain affiliated with the University of Cambridge as a [Visiting Scientist](https://neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/member/opk20){:target="_blank"}, where my research focuses on developing algorithms for characterizing brain connectivity from MRI scans and understanding how connectivity is altered in depression.
