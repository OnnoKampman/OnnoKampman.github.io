Thanks for visiting!

I lead AI initiatives for [mindline.sg](https://mindline.sg){:target="_blank"} at the [MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT)](https://moht.com.sg){:target="_blank"} in Singapore, where I work on a portfolio of projects at the intersection of AI and mental health.
My goal is to explore how technology can help scale and improve our mental health care systems.

I'm also involved with [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.github.io){:target="_blank"}, a non-profit organization working to boost AI performance and inclusion across Southeast Asia.

Additionally, I remain affiliated with the University of Cambridge as a [Visiting Scientist](https://neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/member/opk20){:target="_blank"}.
My research focuses on developing algorithms for the characterization of brain connectivity based on MRI scans, and how brain connectivity is altered in depressed individuals.
